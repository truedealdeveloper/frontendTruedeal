        content: 'We had an amazing experience booking our package for Kashmir with Truedeal. Mr. Vineet Singh and Mr. Aman Arora were extremely helpful and responsive throughout the entire process right from booking to the time when we came back from the trip. Vineet was super patient with our queries and he tried his best to tailor the package as per our request, even with the limited time we had for bookings. The package included good hotels and visits to the beautiful sightseeing spots. The cab provided was well maintained and driver bhaiya Javid Shalla was also extremely sweet and helpful and he guided us nicely throughout the entire trip with respect to food, places, timings, weather situation and even shopping discounts. He was always punctual with the pickup timings. When we got stuck at Gulmarg due to extreme snow fall, we were worried about our safety but Javid bhaiya waited for us downhill and called us often to ensure our safety. Truedeal also went the extra mile to arrange alternate accommodation at The Kabo in Srinagar when we couldnt reach our pre-booked hotel in Pahalgam due to bad weather conditions. We are happy that we were lucky to witness snowfall when it was not on the predictions. We would highly recommend our friends and relatives to book their trips with Truedeal and we ourselves are gonna prefer them to plan our upcoming couple and family vacations. Thank you Truedeal for making our Kashmir trip so memorable.',

I recently returned from my trip to Thailand, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service provided by your team.

From the initial planning stages to the final execution, everything was seamless and well-organized. The itinerary you created for me was perfect, and I enjoyed every moment of my trip.

The hotels, transportation, and activities you arranged were all top-notch, and I was impressed by the attention to detail.

I would especially like to thank Aman and Rashid for their professionalism, knowledge, and responsiveness. They were always available to answer my questions and provide guidance throughout the trip.

I would highly recommend Trudeal Travel to anyone planning a trip to Thailand. Your team's expertise and dedication to customer satisfaction are truly exceptional.

Thank you again for making my trip to Thailand an unforgettable experience!

Best regards,

1) During our trip we got stuck in SaPa due to typhoon yagi and our indian trip organiser Mr. Rashid has really helped us in getting out of the region.
2) However , the Vietnam organizers were very reluctant and I felt they were not interested in getting is out and due this our trip was completely ruined and we have to cancel our flights and divert the iternity.

During our initial 3 days we enjoyed a lot but last 5 days of trip was not worthy.
However the hotels and hospitality provided by Vietnamese were beyond our expectations.

We could communicate at any time with the local team, who were very helpful and responsive.

The planning and execution was done perfectly keeping us free from any hassle to enjoy the vacation and refresh ourselves into the new year. Thank you Rashid (True Deal) for all the help.

Hope everyone has a great year ahead.

It was an excellent and pleasant experience for food, guides, hotels and a joyful journey. There were some shortcomings due to which I have given 1 star less, which is the time management, mentioning each and every point in time and adding adventure in the journey. to do
Those who want to do adventure can do so and the main point is to plan the trip keeping in mind the age of the people so that people of all ages can enjoy it.

        Our recent trip to Bali was an absolute delight, all thanks to the seamless arrangements made by Mr. Vineet and Mr. Gaurav. From the very beginning, their professionalism, attention to detail, and personalized service ensured that our journey was hassle-free and enjoyable. They were always available to answer our questions and made sure every aspect of the trip was well-planned.

A special mention goes to our guide and driver Mr. Detria in Bali, who truly made the trip unforgettable. The guide was incredibly knowledgeable, sharing fascinating insights about Balis culture, history, and hidden gems, which enriched our experience. They were not just informative but also warm and friendly, making us feel at home throughout the journey.

Our driver was equally impressive — always punctual, polite, and exceptionally skilled at navigating Balis roads. They ensured our safety and comfort at every step, and their local tips helped us explore Bali in the best possible way.

Together, the guide and driver went above and beyond to make our trip special, catering to our needs with a smile and ensuring we created memories that will last a lifetime.

Thank you, Mr. Vineet and Mr. Gaurav, for such impeccable service and for providing us with such an amazing team in Bali. We highly recommend your agency to anyone planning a trip and will certainly be booking with you again for our future travels!

        We had a mixture of good and bad experiences. Finding the driver and  reaching the hotel were smooth and comfortable. Day 1 comprised of visit to to Tanah lot temple and view of the sunset, which is amazing. Day 2 was supposed to be water activities, however the same was removed by the team at the 11th hour (payment included water activities) due to some festival in Bali. We were informed that there won't be any water activities in Bali in this festival duration. But we have seen people doing water activities at Nusa Penida. When enquired, I realised that the cost of every water sports activities are very high. Coming back to Day 2; so the team planned a visit to Garuda Vishnu temple instead, which would have benefited the travel team as the ticket cost are less compared to water activities. My recommendation to include 1 day Ubud day tour was not considered. After walking kilometers under the hot sun in GWT (buggy was included in our package), we went for lunch followed by visit to Uluwatu temple. Kechak dance and view at Uluwatu is really amazing. Day 3 we visited Nusa Penida. The team planned 2 days stay in Nusa Penida. However, our visits to 3 beaches were completed by 0330 pm (for those who didn't understand I will tell you, we just visited every place for taking photo and returned back). Our driver asked us to return within 15-30 min from every site. Our boat to Bali was on next day 4:30 pm. If we had 1 full day of free time, why did the driver rushed everything and completed trip by 03:30. In the hotel we stayed at Nusa Penida, we saw snake falling from the roof top to bed. After wasting 1 day in Nusa Penida (Day 4) we boarded the ferry to Bali port which is close to airport (next day early morning we have our return flight from Bali). From there we travelled 2-3 hrs north and reached Ubud at 09:30 pm. I was amazed with the ambience in Ubud. Beautiful crowd and party vibe everywhere. But our excitement didn't last long we were tired and the street slowly winded up the parties in another 1 -2 hrs. Next day we got up at 5am and left to airport at 6am. Travelled all the way down to south for the airport. As I said earlier, our trip to Bali was a mixture of good and bad experience.
