    content: `Mahakumbh 2025 Traffic Update: 300-KM Gridlock Strands Pilgrims for Hours

The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 has led to unprecedented traffic congestion, with jams extending over 300 kilometers, leaving thousands of pilgrims stranded. Highways leading to Prayagraj resemble massive parking lots as authorities struggle to manage the overwhelming rush.

Major Traffic Bottlenecks

According to the latest Mahakumbh traffic updates, key routes from Katni, Jabalpur, and Rewa are facing severe gridlocks. Even alternate roads are now witnessing heavy congestion, with social media flooded with images of devotees stuck for hours.

Why Is the Traffic So Bad?

- The sheer volume of pilgrims has far exceeded expectations.
- Despite predictions of a decline after Basant Panchamis Amrit Snan, the number of visitors continues to rise.
- Authorities have implemented the Mahakumbh traffic plan, restricting vehicle movement at various points to control the situation.

Transport Disruptions

- The Prayagraj Sangam railway station has been temporarily shut down due to overcrowding.
- Key Mahakumbh traffic routes connecting Varanasi, Lucknow, and Kanpur to Prayagraj remain clogged, with jams stretching up to 25 kilometers in some areas.

What Pilgrims Should Do

1. Check the Mahakumbh traffic plan before traveling.
2. Consider alternative routes to avoid long delays.
3. Use public transport wherever possible.

With an estimated 40 crore visitors expected by February 26, officials continue working to ease congestion, but challenges are likely to persist in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Mahakumbh traffic updates.`,
